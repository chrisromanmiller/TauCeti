# Finite-dimensional representations

This file records how the forgetful functor `FDRep R G ⥤ Rep R G` preserves module-finiteness,
finrank and characters. These facts let results proved for representation carriers transfer back to
`FDRep`, in particular in `TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Induction.FiniteDimensional`. In the same
spirit it records that rebundling the representation an object carries returns that object, which
is the identification a construction phrased as `FDRep.of ρ` needs in order to be read as a
statement about the object it started from.

It also records the character of a trivial representation, the constant `finrank`, in both the
`Representation` and the `FDRep.of` spellings in which consumers meet it.

An object of `FDRep k G` carries a module in the universe of `k`, so `FDRep.of` accepts a
representation only when its carrier already lies there. A module-finite carrier is however always
*equivalent* to one that does, because it is spanned by finitely many vectors over `k`;
`FDRep.ofShrink` performs that transport, and the lemmas beside it say that the transport changes
neither the dimension nor the character. Only the character transfer needs `k` to be a field, `k`
being a commutative ring throughout otherwise.

Finally it records the structural properties of the character that Mathlib's
`RepresentationTheory/Character.lean` leaves out beside `FDRep.char_iso` and `FDRep.char_tensor`:
the character is **additive on biproducts** and vanishes on the **zero** representation, and the
character of the **tensor unit** is the constant function `1`. Those are what is still missing
before the character can be read as a ring homomorphism out of the representation ring,
`TauCeti.repRingCharacter`.

## Main definitions

* `FDRep.ofShrink`: a module-finite representation on a carrier in an arbitrary universe, as an
  object of `FDRep k G`.

## Main statements

* `Representation.char_trivial`: the character of a trivial representation is the dimension of its
  carrier, whence `FDRep.character_of_trivial` for the trivial representation on `k` itself.
* `FDRep.moduleFinite_forget₂_obj`: the forgotten carrier is module-finite.
* `FDRep.finrank_forget₂_obj`: forgetting does not change finrank.
* `FDRep.character_forget₂_obj`: forgetting does not change the character.
* `FDRep.of_ρ_eq_self`: rebundling the representation carried by an object returns that object.
* `FDRep.ofShrinkEquiv`: `FDRep.ofShrink ρ` carries a representation equivalent to `ρ`, whence
  `FDRep.finrank_ofShrink` and `FDRep.character_ofShrink`.
* `FDRep.char_biprod`: the character is additive on biproducts, with `FDRep.char_zero` the
  character of the zero representation.
* `FDRep.char_tensorUnit`: the character of the tensor unit is the constant function `1`.
